## A note (9 May 2025)

Those of you who paid close attention to the model architecture may have noticed that the so-called "DenseNet" is not a true DenseNet; Instead of all convolutional layers in a stack feeding to all forward conv layers, they only feed to the immediately next conv layer. I did not notice this error, nor did anyone else, until way after this project was completed.

I do not have the money to spare for Google Colab computing time so I will not be re-running my notebooks.
